# Aversive learning task

A probabilistic reversal learning task of 120 trials.

In each trial, the participants have to select one of two fractals. They are instructed to choose the fractal of which they expected to get a pleasant sound, rather an unpleasant one. One of the two presented fractals was randomly assigned to be the correct stimulus, leading to a plesant sound in 80%, causing an unpleasant sound in 20% of the trials. The incorrect stimulus had a unpleasant sound-probability of 20% and thus resulted in pleasant sound in 80%. There are 5 fixed points where the contigencies swap.

The participants were informed that the sound contingencies can occasionally switch. No information was given about the win probabilities and the frequency or other characteristics of the reversals.

There is a tutorial to familiarize with the task. During this training, no reversal occurred. The presented stimuli did not change over the course of the run.
